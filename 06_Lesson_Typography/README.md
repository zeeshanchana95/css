# Typography
- It is the **way that text is arranged and presented**

- Today, we will be working with **Text and Font** in CSS.

- We have already seen that by default font and text settings is being inherited from the parent but they **do not inherit inside of form**

- **text-decoration:line-through;** use where we need to cross something, in the same, we can use other properties as well.

- **text-decoration:none;** usefull when we want to remove underline from links which by default are underlined.

- **text-transform: capitalize;** will transform first letter into **capital**

- **text-transform: uppercase;** will capitilazie all text

- any time value has space between words, need to wrap them in quotes

- **Web Safe Fonts** not need to installed on the local but they are on the web and can be used.

# Pseudo Selectors:
- they include both classes and pseudo elements

## Difference between Pseudo class and Pseudo Selector:
- pseudo-class selects elements that are in specific state like **a:visited**, **a:hover**, **a:link**, **a:hover**, **a:active** etc. These are specific states of an element

- pseudo elements use **::** two colons instead of one colon and they act like we add element into your document.

- **is** pseudo class is going to adapt whatever has the highest specicificity within its parenthesis

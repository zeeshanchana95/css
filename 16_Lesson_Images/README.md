# CSS Images:
1. Foreground Images:
    - images on the page
2. Background Images:
    - images on the background

- images are not block-level elements but actually inline

- always try to use the size of the image twice as big as the normal size of the image in small devices when the screen size changes to smaller to larger then it looks nice otherwise it looks blury on large screen sizes
